# Python Timegraph

Python library for computing temporal relations between temporally-bounded events using the timegraph algorithm [[1,2]](#references).

A timegraph is a directed, acyclic graph whose vertices represent single points in time, and whose edges represent a â‰¤ ("before or at") relationship. Each event corresponds to two points in the timegraph: one representing the beginning of the episode, and one representing the end of the episode (with the first coming before the second).



## Dependencies



## Summary

Install the package using `pip install timegraph`.

Import the package using the following line.

```python
from timegraph import timegraph
```
